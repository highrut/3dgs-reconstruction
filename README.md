## Overview

SuGaR optimization starts with first optimizing a 3D Gaussian Splatting model for 7k iterations with no additional regularization term. Consequently, the current implementation contains a version of the original <a href="https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting">3D Gaussian Splatting code</a>, and we the model is built as a wrapper of a vanilla 3D Gaussian Splatting model.

The full SuGaR pipeline consists of 4 main steps, and an optional one:
1. **Short vanilla 3DGS optimization**: optimizing a vanilla 3D Gaussian Splatting model for 7k iterations, in order to let Gaussians position themselves in the scene.
2. **SuGaR optimization**: optimizing Gaussians alignment with the surface of the scene.
3. **Mesh extraction**: extracting a mesh from the optimized Gaussians.
4. **SuGaR refinement**: refining the Gaussians and the mesh together to build a hybrid Mesh+Gaussians representation.
5. **Textured mesh extraction (Optional)**: extracting a traditional textured mesh from the refined SuGaR model.

## Installation

### 0. Requirements

The software requirements are the following:
- Conda (recommended for easy setup)
- C++ Compiler for PyTorch extensions
- CUDA toolkit 11.8 for PyTorch extensions
- C++ Compiler and CUDA SDK must be compatible

Please refer to the original <a href="https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting">3D Gaussian Splatting repository</a> for more details about requirements.

### 1. Clone the repository

Start by cloning this repository:

```shell
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/Anttwo/SuGaR.git --recursive
```

or

```shell
# SSH
git clone git@github.com:Anttwo/SuGaR.git --recursive
```

### 2. Creating the Conda environment

To create and activate the Conda environment with all the required packages, go inside the `SuGaR/` directory and run the following command:

```shell
python install.py
conda activate sugar
```

This script will automatically create a Conda environment named `sugar` and install all the required packages. It will also automatically install the <a href="https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting">3D Gaussian Splatting</a> rasterizer as well as the <a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/nvdiffrast/">Nvdiffrast</a> library for faster mesh rasterization.

If you encounter any issues with the installation, you can try to follow the detailed instructions below to install the required packages manually.

Detailed instructions for manual installation
</span></summary>

#### a) Install the required Python packages
To install the required Python packages and activate the environment, go inside the `SuGaR/` directory and run the following commands:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sugar
```

If this command fails to create a working environment, you can try to install the required packages manually by running the following commands:
```shell
conda create --name sugar -y python=3.9
conda activate sugar
conda install pytorch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install -c fvcore -c iopath -c conda-forge fvcore iopath
conda install pytorch3d==0.7.4 -c pytorch3d
conda install -c plotly plotly
conda install -c conda-forge rich
conda install -c conda-forge plyfile==0.8.1
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets
pip install open3d
pip install --upgrade PyMCubes
```

#### b) Install the Gaussian Splatting rasterizer

Run the following commands inside the `SuGaR` directory to install the additional Python submodules required for Gaussian Splatting:

```shell
cd gaussian_splatting/submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization/
pip install -e .
cd ../simple-knn/
pip install -e .
cd ../../../
```
Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting">3D Gaussian Splatting repository</a> for more details.

#### c) (Optional) Install Nvdiffrast for faster Mesh Rasterization

Installing Nvdiffrast is optional but will greatly speed up the textured mesh extraction step, from a few minutes to less than 10 seconds.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrast
cd nvdiffrast
pip install .
cd ../
```

## Quick Start

Create data folder in the root folder of this repository and move your images to data/SCENE_NAME/input.

Then, run
```shell
python ./run_sh SCENE_NAME
```

The `view_sugar_results.ipynb` notebook provides examples of how to load SuGaR reconstruction, render a scene from Gaussian and mesh representation, and assess the quality of a reconstructed mesh.
